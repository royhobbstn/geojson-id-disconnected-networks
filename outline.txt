// create a object hash of all points


// LOOP

// pick first point and last point

// call this network A

// run path through Djikstra

// - handle if no path found: probably pick next two points?

// get list of used points

// assign all of these points to Network A in the object hash

// loop through object hash, if undefined points remaining, choose first 2 unused points

//  - if 1 unused point remaining, handle this

// run through // LOOP

// count number of points in each network.  Order networks by size of points in each

// - example Network B is biggest, becomes __order: 1, network A is second biggest, becomes __order: 2

// return geojson to user with this extra column
